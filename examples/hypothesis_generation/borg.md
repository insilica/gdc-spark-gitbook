# BORG - Bioinformatics Orphan Gene Rescue Graphical Models
  The BORG (bioinformatics orphan gene rescue graphical models) is an approach to hypothesis generation. BORG searches for little-known biological entities strongly related to a clinical endpoint.  In this example we use the BORG pipeline to find genes related to a clinical endpoint such as colon cancer tumor stage.
