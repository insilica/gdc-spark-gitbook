# Tumor Aggression
  Cancer aggression describes cancer lethality, metastasis, growth velocity, and more.  Aggression metrics include categorical, numeric and boolean features:
  
  1. **Tumor Stage:**  
  Categorical with least aggressive (1) to most aggressive (4).  Based on tumor location, size, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis (see [cancerstaging.org](https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/Pages/What-is-Cancer-Staging.aspx)).
  2. **Lympatic invasion:**  
  True/False. Occurs when cancer cells break into lymphatic vessels.
  3. **Vascular Invasion:**  
  True/False. Occurs when cancer cells break into blood vessels. 
  4. **Histological Type:**  
  Categorical. Non-Mucinous vs Mucinous. 
  5. **Percent Positive Lymph Nodes**  
  Numeric 0-100. Histological sections contain lymph nodes positive/negative for cancer.  
  6. **Distant Metastasis**
  True/False
