1. [Install gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md)

2. Clone this repo
 `git clone https://github.com/insilica/gdc-spark-gitbook`

3. Install dependencies  
  ```
  > cd ./gdc-spark-gitbook
  > gitbook install
  ```
  Read about the included dependencies and what commands they allow in the **commands** section below.

4. serve the book `> gitbook serve`

## Commands

###[bibtex-cite](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/bibtex-cite)
I'm still experimenting with this.  It's not hard to write these plugins so maybe we just need to rewrite some of them.  This plugin and similar ones were written for earlier versions of gitbook.

Who swung the first hammer stone? Early human ancestors may have hefted tools more than three million years ago, ancient hand bones suggest. That’s roughly half a million years earlier than the oldest stone tools yet discovered.

The hand-bone analysis, led by the United Kingdom’s Matthew Skinner of the University of Kent in Canterbury, compared the internal structure of hand bones from modern people, chimps, apes, Neanderthals, and early human species.

Most notably in the study, released Thursday by the journal Science, researchers report on the hands of Australopithecus africanus, best known from the pierced skull of the famed “Taung child,” who may have been killed by an eagle about 2.5 million years ago.

While the pattern of spongy bone in ape hands doesn’t show signs of humanlike uses such as pinching or hammer holding, the researchers write, the hand bones of Australopithecus do. Rather than bones for knuckle-walking or tree climbing, under the palms of these early humans were anchor bones “consistent with forceful opposition of the thumb and fingers typically adopted during tool use.”
