# Guide to the Genomic Data Commons
  The Genomic Data Commons is a large data repository for cancer related patient data.  This book is an introduction to simple analyses made possible with access to GDC (Genomic Data Commons).  We review some of the biology, statistics and computer science behind every step of the examples.  These reviews include explanations of the biology behind GDC experimental files. We describe how to extract and organize GDC data.  We also propose methods for building computational workflows on top of this data.
