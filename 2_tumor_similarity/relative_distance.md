# Relative Tumor Distances
Bioinformatics is full of careful considerations of statistical biases hidden in biological experiments. RNA sequencing is no exception.  RNA sequencing results in counts of biological entities, in our case ensembl genes.  We assume information embedded in rna sequencing experiments can predict clinical outcomes. At a higher level, we might say tumors with 'similar' rna sequencing results have similar behavior.  

Similarity is a tricky and well explored concept in machine learning.
